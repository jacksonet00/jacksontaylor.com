# Coming Updates

This site was recently redesigned and there are still quite a few things I want to do. I'll be keeping a log of them right here.

-    New code blocks. The Chakra UI code block components absolutely suck, so I need to find an alternative. I need one with language specific syntax highlighting as well. The problem that presents itself now is how to pipe that info down from the markdown interpreter to the code block component.

-    Advanced theming. Chakra has some advanced theming features that I want to try out. Bacially you can create a your own theme system like iOS has so that your styling can be agnostic to dark/light mode or accessibility settings.

-    Redesign the blog page. Right now the blog just takes you to an unordered list of links which are blog posts.

-    Improve CMS system. Currently it is pretty good. I just push a markdown file to GitHub and I'm done. My site automatically generates a route to /blog/filename and renders the markdown as HTML at that make. It also rebuilds and deploys automatically. I want to see if there is anything I can do to improve this system, even though CMS systems already exist and I could use them, I'm enjoying learning to put this automation together.
