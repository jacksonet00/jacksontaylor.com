# My Stack

Right now I'm working on developing my own personal stack that I like to use for building GraphQL servers. Currently I have a small project I'm working on simply for the sake of developing some design patterns to build my side project with. Once I have it all defined how I like my backend folder structure and code blocks to look, it will be so simple to convert it to any API I need. In the long run, creating these design patterns could save me a ton of time.

## Technologies

Here are the technologies I currently have incorporated in my stack:

- Python (programming language)
- PostgreSQL (database)
- SQL Alchemy (ORM)
- Graphene (GraphQL library)
- Flask GraphQL Auth (JWT library)

### Small Scale

- Docker (containerization)
- Heroku (deployment)

### Large Scale

- Look into Fauna for serverless graphql

- AWS Lambda
- AWS RDS

## Strategies

Ultimately, it would be really cool if I could abstract away a lot of the differences between the small and large scale deployment so that you could easily switch between the two with a config file. Shouldn't really worry about that until I have something that needs larger scale first.
